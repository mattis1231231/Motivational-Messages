This Twilio bot sends good feel SMS messages to brighten your day. Every morning, you'll receive a positive message delivered straight to your phone. Whether you're in need of a little motivation or just want to start your day on a positive note, this bot has you covered. From inspiring quotes to uplifting messages, you can count on it to send you a daily dose of good vibes. This project is open source and available for anyone to use.


To set up and use a Twilio bot that sends good feel SMS messages, follow these instructions:

1. Sign up for a Twilio account and obtain your Account SID, Auth Token, and Twilio phone number. You will need these to authenticate your API requests.

2. Set up a phone number to send the SMS messages. You can do this through the Twilio dashboard or by using the Twilio API.

3. Download the code for the Twilio bot from the GitHub repository.

4. Install the necessary dependencies. The bot may require certain libraries or modules to be installed in order to run. These will be listed in the documentation for the bot.

5. Edit the code to include your Twilio credentials (Account SID, Auth Token, and Twilio phone number) and the phone number you want to send the SMS messages to.

6. Set up a schedule to send the SMS message every day. You can do this using a scheduling service such as cron on a Linux server, or using a service like AWS Lambda to run your code on a schedule.

7. Run the code to start sending the SMS messages.
